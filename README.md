# AWS EKS Application Platform

A production-style reference platform built on **Amazon EKS** using **Terraform** for infrastructure, **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD, and **CloudWatch** for observability.  
This project demonstrates how to provision a secure EKS cluster, deploy a containerized frontend, expose it publicly, and monitor costs and performance â€” following real-world practices.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

**Core features**
- **Infrastructure as Code (Terraform):** VPC, EKS cluster, managed node groups, cost controls.
- **Application Delivery:** GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline builds and pushes app images to ECR, then deploys them to EKS.
- **Observability:** Container Insights and CloudWatch Logs for metrics, dashboards, and alerts.
- **Cost Visibility:** Unified tagging and an AWS Budget for spend awareness.
- **Demo Application:** A simple static frontend served via NGINX and exposed through a LoadBalancer service.
